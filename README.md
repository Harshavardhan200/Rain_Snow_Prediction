# Rain_Snow_Prediction README

## Overview
This project analyzes weather data to uncover patterns and insights. It uses Python-based data science tools to process, visualize, and interpret weather-related datasets. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and potentially predictive modeling to understand weather trends.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handles weather datasets, including cleaning, formatting, and preliminary analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Generates graphs and charts such as temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and more.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Includes descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing on weather data.
- **Predictive Modeling** (if applicable): Employs machine learning models to predict weather parameters based on historical data.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Weather Analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the analysis. Modify paths or parameters as necessary to suit your dataset.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` (if predictive modeling is implemented)

## File Structure
- `Weather Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the code and analysis
- `data/`: Directory to store raw and processed datasets
- `output/`: Directory to save visualizations and analysis results

## Data
Ensure the weather dataset is available in the `data/` directory. Update the file paths in the notebook to point to the correct dataset.
